Link to tutorial: https://bit.ly/2wMAE34

 ## Database
 [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) is a non-sql database in the cloud.
 
 ## Server
 The server is written in Node.js and uses multiple libraries. 
 * [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is used the ORM that creates schemas for MongoDB
 * [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is used as a simple framework to set up the server
 * [GraphQL Server](https://graphql.org/) is the query language used to create queries to the database
 ## Client
 
 The front-end is written in React and uses [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) to translate GraphQL queries from the front-end to the server.
